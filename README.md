# sort-data-with-sql
This is a project I started to improve my skills with SQL.
## List of task to accomplish
- Get the data in CSV file
- Analyze the columns
- Sort the data by categories

### The Data
The data I'm going to use is from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) website where I downloaded a CSV file of Crops and livestock products, especially for Africa.
### Analyze Columns
After importing the data into my SQL tool, I'm going to get all the from a specific country, in this case, the one for Republic of Benin.
SELECT *
FROM database name
WHERE Area = 'Benin';
